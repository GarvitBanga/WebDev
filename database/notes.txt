MongoDB

NoSQL databases are a broad category of database systems that diverge from the traditional relational model used in SQL databases. 

They are designed to handle a variety of data models and workloads that may not fit neatly into the tabular schema of relational databases.


Schema Flexibility: NoSQL databases often allow for a flexible schema, meaning you can store data in formats that don't require a fixed structure.
Scalability: Many NoSQL databases are designed to scale out horizontally, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers and handle large volumes of traffic.



MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented approach. Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can have nested structures and varied fields.
