MongoDB

NoSQL databases are a broad category of database systems that diverge from the traditional relational model used in SQL databases. 

They are designed to handle a variety of data models and workloads that may not fit neatly into the tabular schema of relational databases.


Schema Flexibility: NoSQL databases often allow for a flexible schema, meaning you can store data in formats that don't require a fixed structure.
Scalability: Many NoSQL databases are designed to scale out horizontally, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers and handle large volumes of traffic.



MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented approach. Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can have nested structures and varied fields.


Why should you hash passwords?

Password hashing is a technique used to securely store passwords in a way that makes them difficult to recover or misuse. Instead of storing the actual password, you store a hashed version of it. 

salt- A popular approach to hashing passwords involves using a hashing algorithm that incorporates a salt—a random value added to the password before hashing. This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords.

Bcrypt: It is a cryptographic hashing algorithm designed for securely hashing passwords. Developed by Niels Provos and David Mazières in 1999, bcrypt incorporates a salt and is designed to be computationally expensive, making brute-force attacks more difficult.


Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and obtain the original input.
