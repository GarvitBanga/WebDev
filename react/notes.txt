React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

State and Component

State is the data that is stored in a component. It is used to keep track of the data that is displayed in the component.

Component is a part of the user interface that is responsible for rendering the data. It is a reusable, dynamic piece of code that can be used to build user interfaces. 
It changes the state of the component and re-renders the component.

A state change triggers a re-render of the component. A re-render is a process of updating the user interface to reflect the new state of the component.
A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes.


We just have to define all the components once and then all we have to do is update the state of your app and React takes care of re-render the components.
