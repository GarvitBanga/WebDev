Stateful tokens are tokens that are generated for each user and are stored in the database.

The problem is that we need to send a request to the database to get the token for each request, everytime the user wants to hit an authenticated endpoint.

JWTs
JSON web tokens are a compact and self contained way to represent information between 2 parties.
Commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications.
JWTs are Stateless-contain all information needed to authenticate a request, so the server doesn't need to store sesssion information. All the data is stored in the JWT itself.
it's encoded and not encrypted.
