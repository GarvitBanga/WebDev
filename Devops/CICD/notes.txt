Continuous Integration**

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, preferably several times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by

1. Building the project and
2. Running automated tests.

This process allows teams to detect problems early, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

Continuous Deployment**

As the name suggests, deploying your code `continuously` to various environments (dev/stage/prod)


# Some special files in github

In a codebase if a file is inside of `.github/workflows`

It is considered a CI file which means github will run the contents of the files whenever the conditions are met.

## Some useful cases where this might be handy:

- To run unit/integrated tests
- To run lint/format checking
- To build the application
- Deploy it whenever someone pushes their code
