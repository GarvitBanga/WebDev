Continuous Integration**

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, preferably several times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by

1. Building the project and
2. Running automated tests.

This process allows teams to detect problems early, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

Continuous Deployment**

As the name suggests, deploying your code `continuously` to various environments (dev/stage/prod)
