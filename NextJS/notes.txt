react is not good for SEO because google crawler doesn't execute javascript and it only crawls the first request
the first request is the one that loads the html and css and javascript that is index.js
in react projects index.js is the entry point which carries the tsx files to populate the html
so thats why react is not good for SEO
NextJS is a framework for building server-side rendered applications

Waterfalling problem in react is that the first request is the one that loads the html and css and javascript that is index.js.

React does client side rendering.
NextJS does server side rendering.


NextJS needs a server to run the application which will return the loaded page to the browser for better SEO in the first request. this talks with backend server to populate everything on the page.

Reacr can use CDN to load the javascript and css files.

npx create-next-app@latest


Server side components cannot use useState hook and useEffect hook.
if you want to use useState hook and useEffect hook in server side components 
you need to specify the component as a client component.
"use client"; in the first line of the tsx file
