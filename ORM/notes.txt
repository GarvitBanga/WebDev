ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, a programming technique used in software development to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This technique creates a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.
ORMs are used to abstract the complexities of the underlying database into simpler, more easily managed objects within the code
