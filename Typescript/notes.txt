Typescript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javascript. 
Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/nodejs runtime)
Typescript is something that compiles down to javascript
When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking (similar to C++). If there is an error, the conversion to Javascript fails.

npm init -y
npm install typescript
npx tsc --init


npx tsc -b 
build JS file from TS file so that it can be run in the browser using node

No need to upload Js files to the git or server just TS files shoud be enough as running tsc will create the JS files

So that's why we shift TS files to src folder
and then we will enter rootDir in tsconfig.json to be as ./src

    "rootDir": "./src", 
    "outDir": "./dist",

Now we can enter the outdir folder in gitignore and it will not be uploaded to the git


you can also remove comments from the code


You can tunr this to false if you want to use any type
 // "noImplicitAny": true,                            /* Enable error reporting for expressions and declarations with an implied 'any' type. */


 INTERFACES and TYPES

 type can do unions let a:string|number="hello";
 type stringornumber=string|number;
 interface cant do unions
 same for intersections
